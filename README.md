# Comicmgt Random scripts that I use for managing my electronic comic-book
collection and to-read lists.

## Usage

Some of these tools require access to a calibre database, and some
interact with my calibre-comicvine plugin in order to look up metadata
for comics.

Scripts that access the calibre database will need to be invoked from
calibre-debug unless you have a source install and the calibre python
libraries are in your python path
